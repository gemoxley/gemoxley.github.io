            <p>Gray Moxley is a transplant to foggy San Francisco from equally cloud-covered Boston. 
            He credits the lack of Vitamin D growing up with a deep love of staying inside and drawing all day. 
            He is currently attending the University of San Francisco with a double major in Advertising and Design, and definitely drinks a few too many energy drinks.</p>

        <p>His skills include endless patience battling the full Adobe suite of products, as well as a mastery of the Procreate suite. Additionally, he’s well versed in HTML and CSS with plans to delve into JavaScript in the future. </p>
        <p>In his free time, he enjoys listening to music, doodling, playing video games and doing stand-up comedy. His goal in life is to one day illustrate children’s books, and he’s secretly deeply terrified of horses. </p>
